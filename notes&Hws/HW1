1.4. Efficiently handles large data
1.5. Makes data flexible and customizable





windows event log export:

Export as CSV

    Open Event Viewer (Run → eventvwr.msc).
    Locate the log to be exported.
    Select the logs that you want to export, right-click on them and select "Save All Events As".
    Enter a file name that includes the log type and the server it was exported from.
    Save as a CSV (Comma Separated Value) file.

Complete code example:


/*

// initiliaze project
import pandas as pd

// read, import data
urls_df = pd.read_csv('urls_report.csv')


// filtering example
urls_df['Volume Offload'] = (urls_df['COLUMN']*100) / (urls_df['COLUMN'] + urls_df['COLUMN'])
low_offload_urls = urls_df[(urls_df['COLUMN'] > 0) & (urls_df['COLUMN']<50.0)]
low_offload_urls = low_offload_urls[(~low_offload_urls.URL.str.contains("COLUMN")) & (~low_offload_urls.URL.str.contains("COLUMN")) ]

// sorting example
low_offload_urls.sort_values(by=['COLUMN','COLUMN'],inplace=True, ascending=['True','False'])

// print result using foreach
for each_url in low_offload_urls['URL']:
print (each_url)

System - Operating System segments - hardware changes, device drivers, system changes, and all activities related to the machine
Security - The security log is the best and last option to detect and investigate attempted and/or successful unauthorized activity. Event logs can also be used to troubleshoot problems in the system.
Application - Events that are installed in the system. This records the errors that occur in an application, informational events, and warnings from the software applications.

    //What are we looking for in windows log data///
    
    Log centralization - centralize your Windows event logs from multiple servers and desktops. By properly administering your logs, you can track the health of your systems, keep your log files secure, and filter contents to find specific information.
    Data aggregation and collection
    Correlation - 
    Compliance - Prepare for the Worst
    Long-term storage
    Forensic Analysis - It examines structured data with regard to incidents of financial crime.
    
    Making informed security decisions
    Measuring compliance with standards such as PCI, SOX…
    Detecting policy violations
    Identifying and creating a response to security threads
